<h1 id="who-we-are">Who we are</h1>

<p>The Pantheon Sorbonne Master in Economics Alumni Association (PSMEAA) was founded in September 2013 with the aim to stimulate and support the interaction and exchange of former and current master students, professors, staff, friends and supporters of the PSME programme at Pantheon Sorbonne University in Paris.</p>

<p>Until today, over 300 students from all around the world have graduated in PSME. The Association organizes various events throughout the academic year, supports students and its alumni with practical advice for their studies &amp; life in Paris, job opportunities, and networking. New students are introduced and integrated to the PSME alumni family thought events like a Meet Alumni gathering at the beginning of the academic year or at the Annual Alumni meeting in the heart of Paris.</p>

<p>We, the alumni of the PSME programme, work and research all around the world. The main areas are economic positions in governments, corporate and central banks, universities, consultancies, development agencies, insurance companies as well as in private enterprises in the industry. Thanks to the double degree track in Global Economics with Fudan University in Shanghai, around 35 percent of our alumni hale from and live and work in all corners of China. For some bright examples of what we do and what career PSME alumni choose with their degree, check out our Alumni portraits section.</p>
