<blockquote>"PSME has given me an excellent preparation in Economics in general and Macroeconomics in particular. Certain classes like Macroeconomics and History of Economic Thought have shaped my conception of the science and the way I think about macro today. I’ve continued on this path in M2 and now I have the good fortune to be working as a macroeconomist and use what I learned." <span class="quoteauthor" id="alexandru">- Alexandru, Policy Advisor at Insurance Europe</span></blockquote>

<p><img class="profile"src="/img/testimonials/alexandru.jpg">Alexandru graduated from PSME in 2011 and from the ETE M2R (Macroeconomics Track) Programme at the Paris School of Economics in 2012. During the summer break between both programmes he interned at The Economist and worked after his M2 at Crédit Agricole CIB. Alex currently holds the position of Policy Advisor Macroeconomics & Life at Insurance Europe in Brussels.</p>
