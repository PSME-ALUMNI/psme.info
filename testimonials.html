    <blockquote>"PSME has given me an excellent preparation in Economics in general and Macroeconomics in particular. Certain classes like Macroeconomics and History of Economic Thought have shaped my conception of the science and the way I think about macro today. I’ve continued on this path in M2 and now I have the good fortune to be working as a macroeconomist and use what I learned." <span class="quoteauthor" id="alexandru">- Alexandru, Policy Advisor at Insurance Europe, Brussels</span><div style="clear:both"></div></blockquote>

    <p><img class="profile"src="/img/testimonials/alexandru.jpg">Alexandru graduated from PSME in 2011 and from the ETE M2R (Macroeconomics Track) Programme at the Paris School of Economics in 2012.

Alex currently holds the position of Policy Advisor Macroeconomics & Life at Insurance Europe in Brussels.</p>

    <blockquote>"Paris 1 is a realm of knowledge. Don’t give just 100%, but go beyond, meet people, meet professors, participate in extra-curricular activities, invite a French student for coffee, well, you get the idea. All these experiences will prepare for your future. I have learned a great deal of what makes me who I am during my time in Paris." <span class="quoteauthor" id="bruno">- Bruno, Aker Solutions, Kuala Lumpur</span><div style="clear:both"></div></blockquote>

    <p><img class="profile"src="/img/testimonials/bruno.jpg">Bruno finished his high school studies in an international school in Holland. He earned his Bachelor degree in Business Management in the Universidade Federal da Paraiba in Brazil including a year at Manchester Business School in the UK. An internship in the international trade area during the last year of his undergraduate studies gave him experience in elaborating strategies for international markets negotiations and developing global relationships. His acquired knowledge in international relations motivated him to pursue a Masters degree in International Economics at the Panthéon Sorbonne University. Currently, Bruno is working in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia for Aker Solutions, a Norwegian company in the oil and gas business.</p><div style="clear:both"></div>

    <blockquote>"In my opinion, the PSME program was an excellent career preparation. Besides the ambitious curriculum, the program provided me with numerous soft skills that I would never have acquired in a standard M.Sc. program and in a “homogeneous” cultural setting. Needless to say, living in Paris and being able to speak several languages every day was an invaluable extra." <span class="quoteauthor" id="daniel">- Daniel, Economist at the European Central Bank, Frankfurt</span><div style="clear:both"></div></blockquote>

    <p><img class="profile"src="/img/testimonials/daniel.jpg">Daniel came to the PSME after his bachelor studies in Maastricht and Toulouse. After the PSME, he continued with the M.Phil. at Paris 1 and completed the Ph.D. at the Paris School of Economics and the University of Paris 1 – Panthéon Sorbonne. After a number of stops at national central banks and in private banking, he now works as an Economist at the European Central Bank.</p><div style="clear:both"></div>

    <blockquote>"PSME is a once-in-a-life time experience. As it is a small programme, professors are always available to meet up and you will get to know your collegues. Paris will just do the rest, as Hemingway said “If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast”." <span class="quoteauthor" id="federico">- Federico, Consultant, Buenos Aires</span><div style="clear:both"></div></blockquote>

    <p><img class="profile"src="/img/testimonials/federico.jpg">Federico obtained a degree in Economics from the University of Buenos Aires in 2004. After working several years as an economist in the Public Sector, he decided to further invest in his education and entered the PSME programme in 2009.

    <blockquote>"My best memory from PSME has to be the Chinese New Year’s party organized by our Fudan classmates at the Cité Universitaire. The dumplings were amazing; I think I had around 15 of them. The Chinese wine was horrible, but it broke down quickly all cultural boundaries and allowed Fudan and non-Fudan students to really get to know each other." <span class="quoteauthor" id="gabor">- Gabor, Analyst at Morgan Stanley, Budapest</span><div style="clear:both"></div></blockquote>

    <p><img class="profile"src="/img/testimonials/gabor.jpg">Gabor graduated from the PSME class of 2011 and went on to the Money, Banking and Finance Research Master at Paris 1 with a specialization in Finance. During his studies in Paris, he also carried out two interships: One at the Statistics Department of the OECD and the other one at the Economic Research Department of BNP Paribas Corporate and Investment Banking. After his M2 graduation he was hired by Morgan Stanley, where he is currently holding a position as a second-year analyst in the Risk Management Department, working on computing regulatory capital requirements arising from the counterparty credit risk of OTC derivatives. </p><div style="clear:both"></div>

    <blockquote>"Study hard if you want to end up with good academic records, especially in the first year. From my experience courses in the first year require a lot of mathematic preparation. And it takes to time to adapt yourself to life in Paris. Enjoy your time in Paris. I think it is better hanging out more with your classmates and friends than simply staying at home. Also travel a lot as time is so short but there are so many places worth your time." <span class="quoteauthor" id="hanbing">- Hanbing, Agricultural Bank of China, Shanghai</span><div style="clear:both"></div></blockquote>

    <p><img class="profile"src="/img/testimonials/hanbing.jpg">Hanbing had studied in PSME-Fudan Double Degree program since 2010, majoring in World Economy and Globalization, and obtained his master’s degrees in 2012. After his graduation, he managed to land a job in a state-owned bank, the Agricultural Bank of China (short for ABC), which is among the big Four Banks in China. It’s been a year and half since Hanbing has started working for ABC in its provincial bureau, where he is mainly responsible for dealing with provincial government organizations.</p><div style="clear:both"></div>

    <blockquote>"The PSME program set me on a higher platform. I have not only an observation of how the Chinese economy functions but also a vivid reflection on some international economic affairs, such as the European debt crisis and the French political economy. PSME students come from literally worldwide, different backgrounds conflict and embrace with each other, resulting in sparkling inspiration and better reflection on the societies we live in." <span class="quoteauthor" id="jianfeng">- Jianfeng, Analyst at Rio Tinto, Shanghai</span><div style="clear:both"></div></blockquote>

    <p><img class="profile"src="/img/testimonials/jianfeng.jpg">Undergraduate studies offered Jianfeng a comprehensive yet superficial knowledge, while PSME enabled him to dive into the areas that interested him more, say economic growth, environmental economics, etc. He describes this Paris piece of experience simply as "splendid and prolific". Jianfeng participated the Fudan - Paris 1 joint degree program in 2011. After two years of master education with the first year spent in Paris and the second in Shanghai, he majored in World Economy. Jianfeng currently works as a junior analyst for Rio Tinto.</p><div style="clear:both"></div>

    <blockquote>"If you choose PSME program at Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne University and get accepted, then you are both smart and lucky. My advice to you all: Spend time hanging out and exchanging ideas with classmates from diverse backgrounds, but at the same time never forget: study hard! Bonne chance à tous!" <span class="quoteauthor" id="joyce">- Joyce, Research Assistant at the China Europe International Business School, Shanghai</span><div style="clear:both"></div></blockquote>

    <blockquote>"The PSME program is a good preparation for demanding M2 programs and also a great way to get to know people from all over the world. I would recommend the new students to get a bike; I have only discovered in the end that Paris is a great place for biking!" <span class="quoteauthor" id="konrad">- Konrad, Ph.D. Student at Toulouse School of Economics, Toulouse</span><div style="clear:both"></div></blockquote>

    <blockquote>"My best memory from PSME is our gang from the College Franco-Britannique. We became very good friends and keep in touch even if we now live in different countries. Chinese New Year was absolutely stunning – our friends from the Fudan program cooked the whole day to let us taste Chinese specialties. And all these intercultural conversations – how is it in your country, why is it like that, do you like it that way? Many discussions!" <span class="quoteauthor" id="varvara">- Varvara, Analyst at the National Bank of Belgium, Brussels</span><div style="clear:both"></div></blockquote>
