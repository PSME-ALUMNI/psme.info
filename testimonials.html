    <blockquote>"PSME has given me an excellent preparation in Economics in general and Macroeconomics in particular. Certain classes like Macroeconomics and History of Economic Thought have shaped my conception of the science and the way I think about macro today. I’ve continued on this path in M2 and now I have the good fortune to be working as a macroeconomist and use what I learned." <span class="quoteauthor" id="alexandru">- Alexandru, Policy Advisor at Insurance Europe, Brussels</span></blockquote>

    <p><img class="profile"src="/img/testimonials/alexandru.jpg">Alexandru graduated from PSME in 2011 and from the ETE M2R (Macroeconomics Track) Programme at the Paris School of Economics in 2012. During the summer break between both programmes he interned at The Economist and worked after his M2 at Crédit Agricole CIB. Alex currently holds the position of Policy Advisor Macroeconomics & Life at Insurance Europe in Brussels.</p>

    <blockquote>"Paris 1 is a realm of knowledge. Don’t give just 100%, but go beyond, meet people, meet professors, participate in extra-curricular activities, invite a French student for coffee, well, you get the idea. All these experiences will prepare for your future. I have learned a great deal of what makes me who I am during my time in Paris." <span class="quoteauthor" id="bruno">- Bruno, Aker Solutions, Kuala Lumpur</span></blockquote>

    <p><img class="profile"src="/img/testimonials/bruno.jpg">Bruno finished his high school studies in an international school in Holland. He earned his Bachelor degree in Business Management in the Universidade Federal da Paraiba in Brazil including a year at Manchester Business School in the UK. An internship in the international trade area during the last year of his undergraduate studies gave him experience in elaborating strategies for international markets negotiations and developing global relationships. His acquired knowledge in international relations motivated him to pursue a Masters degree in International Economics at the Panthéon Sorbonne University. Currently, Bruno is working in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia for Aker Solutions, a Norwegian company in the oil and gas business.</p><div style="clear:both"></div>

    <blockquote>"In my opinion, the PSME program was an excellent career preparation. Besides the ambitious curriculum, the program provided me with numerous soft skills that I would never have acquired in a standard M.Sc. program and in a “homogeneous” cultural setting. Needless to say, living in Paris and being able to speak several languages every day was an invaluable extra." <span class="quoteauthor" id="daniel">- Daniel, Economist at the European Central Bank, Frankfurt</span></blockquote>

    <p><img class="profile"src="/img/testimonials/daniel.jpg">Daniel came to the PSME after his bachelor studies in Maastricht and Toulouse. After the PSME, he continued with the M.Phil. at Paris 1 and completed the Ph.D. at the Paris School of Economics and the University of Paris 1 – Panthéon Sorbonne. After a number of stops at national central banks and in private banking, he now works as an Economist at the European Central Bank.</p><div style="clear:both"></div>

    <blockquote>"PSME is a once-in-a-life time experience. As it is a small programme, professors are always available to meet up and you will get to know your collegues. Paris will just do the rest, as Hemingway said “If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast”." <span class="quoteauthor" id="federico">- Federico, Consultant, Buenos Aires</span></blockquote>

    <p><img class="profile"src="/img/testimonials/federico.jpg">Federico obtained a degree in Economics from the University of Buenos Aires in 2004. After working several years as an economist in the Public Sector, he decided to further invest in his education and entered the PSME programme in 2009. After having spent there an amazing time with enriching academic and personal experiences, he went back to Argentina where Federico currently works in consulting and as a teaching assistant in Development Economics.</p><div style="clear:both"></div>
