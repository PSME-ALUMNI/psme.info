    <blockquote>"PSME has given me an excellent preparation in Economics in general and Macroeconomics in particular. Certain classes like Macroeconomics and History of Economic Thought have shaped my conception of the science and the way I think about macro today. I’ve continued on this path in M2 and now I have the good fortune to be working as a macroeconomist and use what I learned." <span class="quoteauthor" id="alexandru">- Alexandru, Policy Advisor at Insurance Europe, Brussels</span></blockquote>

    <p><img class="profile"src="/img/testimonials/alexandru.jpg">Alexandru graduated from PSME in 2011 and from the ETE M2R (Macroeconomics Track) Programme at the Paris School of Economics in 2012.

    <blockquote>"Paris 1 is a realm of knowledge. Don’t give just 100%, but go beyond, meet people, meet professors, participate in extra-curricular activities, invite a French student for coffee, well, you get the idea. All these experiences will prepare for your future. I have learned a great deal of what makes me who I am during my time in Paris." <span class="quoteauthor" id="bruno">- Bruno, Aker Solutions, Kuala Lumpur</span></blockquote>

    <p><img class="profile"src="/img/testimonials/bruno.jpg">Bruno finished his high school studies in an international school in Holland. He earned his Bachelor degree in Business Management in the Universidade Federal da Paraiba in Brazil including a year at Manchester Business School in the UK. An internship in the international trade area during the last year of his undergraduate studies gave him experience in elaborating strategies for international markets negotiations and developing global relationships. His acquired knowledge in international relations motivated him to pursue a Masters degree in International Economics at the Panthéon Sorbonne University. Currently, Bruno is working in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia for Aker Solutions, a Norwegian company in the oil and gas business.</p>
