#Courses<a class="anchor" id="courses"></a>
The Panthéon-Sorbonne Master in Economics is a 60 ECTS credits programme. ECTS means «European Credit Transfer System». To know more about ECTS, please click here.

The PSME curriculum includes a comprehensive treatment of modern theory and empirical techniques. Students receive a thorough general training through core courses in microeconomics, macroeconomics, economic growth and econometrics (Fall semester courses), as well as in more specialized fields (Spring semester courses). The rigorous training gives the foundations necessary for graduate studies in economics, and exposure to applied fields will help students wishing to choose a specialization for their second year.

Specially-designed field courses in the second semester include Finance, Globalization and European Economics, Development and Transition Economics, Industrial Organization, History of Economic Thought, Political Economy, Economics of Organizations, Labor Economics, and Population Economics.

In addition to classical training in economic theory, the students will also learn French, at beginner, intermediate, or advanced level, depending on their initial fluency in French.
Given that the student has shown a sufficient improvement in French as a foreign language, the possibility to take one or two courses thaught in French from other Sorbonne Economics Programs exists.

All Economics Lectures are held in small classes of no more than 60 students. Tutorials are organised in smaller classes (no more then 20 students) for all courses within the first semester, to help students understand the courses and do exercises. French courses are given in classes of about 20 students.
