#Dual-Degree Program<a class="anchor" id="Dual-Degree Program"></a>
This dual-degree program aims to provide cutting-edge education in Economics at the graduate level and offers you to obtain a truly global view on the development of the world economy. The faculties of the University of Paris 1 PanthÈon-Sorbonne and Fudan University in Shanghai, which are among the leading Economics Departments in their respective countries, have combined their efforts to organize an innovative international Masters Program specialized in Economics of Globalization and World Economy. Since 2008 this program has successfully trained both non-Chinese and Chinese economists who will become key-experts in Euro-Chinese economic relations.
Additionally, the students choosing this program benefit from a thorough understanding of both cultures through an immersion into two different study environments as they will spend one year studying at Paris 1 doing the PSME program and 1 year studying at Fudan University in Shanghai. Students will receive after their graduation a master degree from each school.
